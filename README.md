# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Project Description
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game! This is a fun and interactive implementation of the classic two-player game that has entertained generations. In this game, players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to align three of their marks in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the game, this version brings a nostalgic experience to your fingertips!

## Features Implemented
This Tic Tac Toe game comes packed with exciting features:
- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend! Enter your names and enjoy a friendly competition.
- **Dynamic Game Board**: The game displays the current state of the board after each move so that you can keep track of your progress.
- **Win and Draw Detection**: The game automatically checks for a winner or a draw and lets you know when it's over.
- **Automatic Game State Saving**: After each game concludes, the state is saved automatically, preserving the outcome for future reference.
- **Input Validation**: The game checks for valid inputs to ensure a smooth gaming experience, preventing players from making illegal moves.
